# Figma mask (not frame)

![](./assets/how-fogma-masking-works.png)

While frame has a built-in clip content property, figma also has a traditional graphics tool masking layer just like in photoshop.

**A slightly bizarre structure**

While frame and other code implementation (css container or flutter clip) has a straight forward hierarchical structure, masking in design tool does not have a hierarchical structure.

Here is a example of how making works

```txt
| (mask) | a | b | d | e | f | g     -- none will be masked
| a | b | (mask) | d | e | f | g     -- a, b will be masked
| a | b  | d | e | f | g | (mask)    -- all will be masked
```

A target masking layer will have property `isMask` set to true.
