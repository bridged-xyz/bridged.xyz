# Component Base

> Component Base or Abstract Component is a base Component that is used for creating variant components.

## Why do we need this?

## Always Create Component Base First.

## Naming Convention

- (base)ComponentName
- \_\_(base)ComponentName

In most times, you may not want your Component Base to be shared through library, to prevent this, you can simply add `__` prefix to your "Component Base" Component's Name, altering `"example"` to `"__example"`
