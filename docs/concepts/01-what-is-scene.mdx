# What is Scene?

We have this terminology - "Scene". Scene is a collection of layers, which can be represented as a Screen or a Component.

**Examples**

- Text or Shape is **not** a Scene.
- Frame **is** a Scene. (optionally)
- Page or Screen **is** a Scene. (which is Frame)
- A Component **is** a Scene.
- A Variant Set is **not** a Scene.
- A Variant **is** a Scene.
- A Instance is **not** a Scene.

## What's special about the Scene?

- Scene is a unit of sharing
  - Once a Node or a Layer is registered as a Scene, you can share
  - You cannot share a Single Text Node.
- Scene is a root, a absolute positioner reletive to its' children
  - When you convert a lyer inside some frame to code, Let's say a Frame, this frame's position will be relative to it's first scene-parent.
- Scene is a unit of processing, This is to prevent recursive generation of code.

_Now we have a clear understanding among layers, scenes and components, we can move on to the next step._
