### By feature / products

**remote ui** - a protocol specification for communicating with your client app. drawing ui by data, sending actions, showing popups remotely, etc..

**inapp bridge** - enables you to develop and deliver seamless web / native app interaction. display native components on webview, embed webview in native view, seamless live interactions.

**schema studio** - we researched more than 2,000 real world application and came up with new design / develop mechanism that which development process is highly dependant on the business schema. by defining your business data models, we generate the prototype best fitting your business, fully customizable, able to export and use as your app base.

**stile** - simply said theme editor, yet. more. based on material design, we created a new way to provide visually stable and aesthetic prototype. the key difference is that the styling is not based on the comonent, but the type of the data.

**bridged ui / typr lang** - (closed alpha) the bridged ui and typr lang is the next gen UML that enables code less project setup. no you still need to code, of course, but not the redundant parts. your time is valuable. dont waste time creating features that are already on the market.

## But wait.

**What is Bridged and when to use it?**

Bridged, by definition, is a set of tools for building seamless and structured, promised application and communication between server and app. or logics. by bridged you can store most of your logic on the serverside, which it should be.

**Is Bridged a framework or a library?**

We'de like to say Bridged is a more of a tool. some of the subsets works as a library, utilities, or framework. all the sub products are designed just to be used together, for the best development expireience we recommand to use them all together. however it works perfectly fine individually.

**Pros**

**Cons**
