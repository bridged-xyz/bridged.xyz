NOTE: This article is intended to share why you are experimenting without any other references.

We found https://www.grida.co/docs/[id] loading takes a long time.

As a result of testing, the [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) version `2.xx` used for mdx rendering did not show the expected speed.
We plan to proceed with the update in anticipation of speed improvement by referring to the release document below.
